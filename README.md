## Getting Started / Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account or Firebase setup
- AWS/GCP account (for deployment)

### Installation Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoodhisattvaCafe/foodhisattva-frontend
cd foodhisattva-frontend
```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

4. **Set up Environment Variables**
Create `.env` files in both `client/` and `server/` directories for API keys, database URIs, etc.

5. **Run Frontend**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

6. **Run Backend**
```bash
cd ../server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.


##  Inventory Prediction Service (Prophet)

We use a lightweight Python-based microservice to predict future inventory needs using Meta's `Prophet` forecasting library. This helps reduce waste and improve stock planning.

###  How to Run the Inventory Prediction Server

1. **Navigate to the model directory**

```bash
cd foodhisattva-frontend/src/app/predict/ml-model
```

2. **Start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn**

```bash
uvicorn predict:app --reload --port 5000
```

Once started, the API will be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:3000/predict
```

You can now make HTTP requests from your frontend or backend to fetch inventory forecasts.

###  API Endpoints for Inventory Management Dashboard

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                                      |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/predict`     | Accepts historical data and returns forecast     |
| GET    | `/predicts`    | Gets historical data and returns forecast        |
| GET    | `/recipies`    | Allows us to peform CRUD Operations on recipies  |
| GET    | `/recipies`    | Allows us to peform  CRUD Operations on sales    |

## Development Retrospective

**Mistakes That Could Be Avoided:**
- Initially underestimated the effort needed for real-time order tracking and notifications.
- Delayed setting up proper CI/CD pipelines and automated testing.

**Cost-Effective Improvements:**
- Started implementing WebSocket-based updates earlier to reduce integration issues.
- Better separation between frontend and backend deployments from the beginning.
- Planned more robust error handling upfront for payment failures and inventory shortages.
